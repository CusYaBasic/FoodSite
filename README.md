# Food Delivery Site

I orginally created this out of bordem as I've always used HTML/PHP for small scale websites but nothing overly big. This is far from finished and only really has basic login avaliable, but it might be a good start for someone who wants to make a website.
Admittingly alot of the PHP stuff could have been done better which is why I started a whole new project from the ground up.

## Features:
* MySQL databases for storing user info
* PHPMailer for testing emails
* Email verifcation
* Forgotten password
* Register account
* Full login
* JWT for security
* Sessions and cookies
* Basic index page with header and sidebar
