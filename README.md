# Food Delivery Site

I orginally created this out of bordem as I've always used HTML/PHP for small scale websites but nothing overly big. This is far from finished and only really has basic login avaliable, but it might be a good start for someone who wants to make a website.
Admittingly alot of the PHP stuff could have been done better which is why I started a whole new project from the ground up.
